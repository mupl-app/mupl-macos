**mupl** â€“ a music player that is fully-written on SwiftUI with a seamless and intuitive interface that feels right at home on macOS. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of [MusicKit](https://developer.apple.com/musickit/), it offers a fully integrated Apple Music experience, allowing users to access their library and explore new music.

## Motivation

The motivation behind developing this macOS music player for Apple Music springs from the widespread dissatisfaction with the official application's performance. Numerous users, including myself, have encountered persistent issues such as bugs, memory leaks, crashes, and overall lack of responsiveness. These problems are not isolated incidents but are echoed across various forums, including Apple Support and Reddit, where a significant number of users have voiced their frustrations. 

Contrasting sharply with its iOS counterpart, which boasts a sleek design and superior technical execution, the macOS version falls short, prompting the need for a reliable, user-friendly alternative that addresses these shortcomings and offers an enhanced listening experience on macOS.
