## Explore

Every contribution to the project, be it a bug report, feature request, or pull request is essential, because the collective input will drive the project forward. Before contributing to the project it is recommended to first explore the existing issues. This understanding helps to see what is currently being tracked and what priorities the project holds. 

Features and bugs can be explored on the [project's boards](https://github.com/orgs/muse-application/projects/1/views/8). If you find a task you want to work on please indicate it in the issue or attach a draft PR to it once available.

## Issues

If you wish to contribute by identifying bugs or suggesting new features, you could open an issue with the use of specific templates. 

When you discover a bug, start by selecting the [bug report](https://github.com/muse-application/muse-macos/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) template. This template will guide you through providing all necessary information about the issue. Although some fields are optional, filling them out can be incredibly helpful.

If you have an idea for a new feature that could enhance the project, use the [feature request](https://github.com/muse-application/muse-macos/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) template to share your suggestion. A clear and concise description is crucial here. Clarity here helps others quickly grasp the value and functionality of your proposed feature. Though including screenshots is optional for feature requests, they can be helpful and can often communicate concepts more effectively than text alone.

## Pull Request

When you are ready to submit your changes to the project, you can open a pull request. 

The PR will be automatically filled with the template, which serves as a guide to ensure you provide all the necessary information about your contribution. Please read the template carefully, because it is essential to understand what is expected in your submission.

The template includes the information you must complete:

- **Description**: Offer a clear explanation of what changes you have made and why. This should be concise yet informative.
- **Related Issues**: Link to any issues your pull request addresses. Please note that issues and PR must be related. If your PR addresses several unrelated issues, it is crucial to separate them.
- **Checklist**: This section is your confirmation that you have adhered to all the submission guidelines. Double-check each item to ensure nothing is missed.
- **Screenshots**: If your changes include visual elements or UI updates, screenshots are required. They provide a quick reference for reviewers to assess the visual impact of your changes.
